This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: modifying a std::vector's elements through a raw pointer obtained using &vec[0].  This approach is dangerous because if the vector needs to reallocate its internal memory (e.g., due to a push_back or resize operation), the pointer becomes invalid, leading to unpredictable results. The bug.cpp file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.cpp offers a safe alternative using iterators or at-access.
